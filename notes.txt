General dot and line
-general dot <- hardware is different, so have to find out hardware info
-need to know width, length, and d (depth of pixel)
-speak directly to hardware or will use the OS? if OS, need to use banks
-if banks, then (ynd)+(xd)

void setPixel(int colour, int x, int y) {
	//get n, m, d
	//addr = (ynd) + (xd)
	//calc bank no, offset, int/switch bank, addr = offset
	//next step depends on depth- if one byte, sb colour- 2- sw colour- 4- sw 0, sw colour
